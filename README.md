<h1 align="center"><b>NL_TIME</b></h1>
First version of nl_time.
Few features that are implemented aren't safely implemented.

**Features to come:**
+  continuous mode, whereas the timer doesn't get reset in between calls to function. (handle NLT_START and NLT_NORESET
+  make program not compile if bad masks are given together, like printf.
+  no time scale or multiple time scales will assume the smallest one (already a feature but make it explicit).
+  COLORS!!!
